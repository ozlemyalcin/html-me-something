         <h3>MeRsIn</h3>
         <p>
            <em>Mersin</em> is the city where I was born. 
            It is a large city and port on the Mediterranean coast in southern <em>Turkey.</em>
            I lived here until I went to college. My family still lives there, and I love <em>Mersin.</em> 
            There's no cold winter , it doesn't snow and it has a great sea to swim in, so I spent a great time in this city where I lived as a child.
